Demo Scene:
This simple demo scene has been setup to allow you to quickly get a feel for how the shaders in this pack work. There is a player character in the scene (a butterfly) you can use to fly around by using the (W,A,S,D) keys on your keyboard.

If you would like to play with the shaders that are shipped in this kit,  open up the ?Main Camera? object under the ?Player_And_Camera? object. This camera has been pre configured with instances of each of the shaders available in this kit, so you can just turn them on/off as you wish and play with the settings.

Enjoy!
